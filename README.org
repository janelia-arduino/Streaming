** Description

   Streaming C++-style Output with Operator <<. Supports _DEC, _BIN, _HEX, _OCT,
   _FLOAT, _PAD, _WIDTH, _WIDTHZ and _FMT stream helpers. See example code for
   usage details.

** Examples

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
const int lettera = 'A';
const int month = 4, day = 17, year = 2009;
const int hour = 8, minute = 20, second = 3;
const float pi = 3.14159;

Serial << "This is an example of the new streaming" << endl;
Serial << "library.  This allows you to print variables" << endl;
Serial << "and strings without having to type line after" << endl;
Serial << "line of Serial.print() calls.  Examples: " << endl;

Serial << "A is " << lettera << "." << endl;
Serial << "The current date is " << day << "-" << month << "-" << year << "." << endl;

Serial << "You can use modifiers too, for example:" << endl;
Serial << _BYTE(lettera) << " is " << _HEX(lettera) << " in hex. " << endl;
Serial << endl;

Serial << "In library v6, you also get" << endl;
Serial << "Padding [" << _PAD(10, '*') << "]" << endl;
Serial << "Width specification [" << _WIDTH(10, 5) << "]" << endl;
Serial << "Leading zeros [" << _WIDTHZ(month,2) << "]" << endl;
Serial << _FMT("Format strings for stuff like dates and times %/%/% %:%:%",
  _WIDTHZ(day, 2), _WIDTHZ(month, 2), year,
  _WIDTHZ(hour,2), _WIDTHZ(minute, 2), _WIDTHZ(second,2)) << endl;
Serial << _FMT(F("To reduce your % size, these % can be in %"), F("sketch"), F("constants"), F("PROGMEM")) << endl;
Serial << endl;

Serial << "pi to 3 digits = " << _FLOAT(pi,3) << endl;

// comma separator
int f = 11;
Serial << "Data: " << 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, f;
Serial << endl;
Serial << "comma separator works!" << endl;
#+END_SRC

** Caveats

- There may be issues using this library with some STL features.
- The esp8266 Arduino core declares several "Stream& operator <<" in StreamDev.h
  and defines them in StreamSend.cpp. If you wish to use this library with the
  esp8266, you may need to comment out those lines in StreamDev.h and
  StreamSend.cpp.
